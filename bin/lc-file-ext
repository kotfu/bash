# given any number of file arguments, rename them so the file extension is lowercase
#
# designed to be used by rules in Hazel because it doesn't do case sensitive filename matching
#
# how files are renamed:
#
# - fred.TAR.GZ -> fred.TAR.gz
# - my-filename -> my-filename
# - ~/Library/Application Support/some-file.TAR -> ~/Library/Application Support/some-file.tar
#
# Usage:
#
#     $ lc-file-ext fred.TAR.GZ
#
# which will rename fred.TAR.GZ to fred.TAR.gz
#
# test whether a file would be renamed by:
#
#     $ lc-file-ext -t my.file.TAR.GZ
#
# 0 exit code indicates there is an uppercase file extension
# 1 exit code indicates there is not an uppercase file extension
